## What is Opaline?

**Opaline** the fluid is the essence of magic within lapis. It can be distilled out the lapis and infused with enchantments to become **Lazurite**, then applied to any tool, weapon, or armor you want. In short, it's a more controlled, more powerful method of enchanting.


Opaline the mod is an in-development mod designed to make the enchanting process less frustrating, but not effortless. In the future, Opaline the fluid may be useful for more than just enchanting.
